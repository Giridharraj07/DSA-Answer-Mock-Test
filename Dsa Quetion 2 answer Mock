Quetion2-Using this implementation:

For x = 4, the output will be 2 because the square root of 4 is 2.
For x = 8, the output will also be 2 because the square root of 8 is approximately 2.82842, rounded down to the nearest integer.
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4] Output: [7,0,8] Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0] Output: [0]

Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9] Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9 It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros

To add two numbers represented by linked lists, you can iterate through the lists simultaneously, adding the corresponding digits and maintaining a carry value. Here's an example implementation in Python:

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1, l2):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    curr = dummy
    carry = 0

    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        sum = carry

        if l1:
            sum += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next

        if l2:
            sum += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next

        carry = sum // 10
        curr.next = ListNode(sum % 10)
        curr = curr.next

    return dummy.next
In this code, we create a dummy node as the head of the result linked list. We also initialize a curr variable to keep track of the current node in the result list, and a carry variable to store the carry value.

The while loop continues until we reach the end of both input linked lists (l1 and l2) and there is no carry value left.

In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the sum of the current digits, considering the carry value. We update the sum based on the values of l1, l2, and the carry.

We calculate the new carry value by dividing the sum by 10 (carry = sum // 10), and the new digit value by taking the modulus of the sum by 10 (curr.next = ListNode(sum % 10)).

We then move the curr pointer to the next node in the result list (curr = curr.next), and update l1 and l2 to their respective next nodes.

Finally, we return the next node of the dummy node, which represents the head of the resulting linked list.

Using this implementation:

For l1 = [2, 4, 3] and l2 = [5, 6, 4], the output will be [7, 0, 8] because 342 + 465 = 807.
For l1 = [0] and l2 = [0], the output will be [0] because 0 + 0 = 0.
For l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] and l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9], the output will be [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1] because 9999999 + 9999 = 10009998.
Note: The implementation assumes that the input linked lists are non-empty and represent non-negative integers without leading zeros.
